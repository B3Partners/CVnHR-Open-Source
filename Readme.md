# CVnHR

This project is commissioned by "Provincie Drenthe" and provides an interface between 
third party applications used in the province and the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KvK).
The application allows for storage of records (inschrijvingen) and provides a simple search
service. Furthermore the application provides batchwise updating and synchronisation.

__Open Source__: The project is made open source to allow other provinces to use this 
application either stand-alone or in combination with the BRMO application by B3partners

Original development is done by QNH Consulting B.V.
